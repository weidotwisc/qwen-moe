// Deadlock freedom for a finite, blocking collective schedule.
//
// This file proves a source-level scheduling property.  It does not define
// `deadlock_free` as an uninterpreted predicate and then assume that predicate.
// Instead it models:
//
//   * a concrete per-rank trace of collective events;
//   * a program counter for every rank;
//   * when a collective is enabled (all members are at the matching event);
//   * the reachable-frontier invariant of atomic collective completion; and
//   * absence of a non-final state in which no collective is enabled.
//
// Different ranks may name different groups at the same phase.  This is
// essential for TP x DP x EP schedules: ranks 0..3 may use one TP group while
// ranks 4..7 simultaneously use another.  What is required is agreement among
// the members of each named group, not equality of every rank's group handle.
//
// TRUST BOUNDARY: the theorem below is about the abstract schedule.  Turning an
// enabled transition into real progress assumes that NCCL completes a matching
// collective in the absence of process/device/network failure and under fair
// scheduling.  The correspondence between the Python call sites and a
// `Schedule` value must also be established by extraction, generation, or
// audit.  Neither assumption is disguised as a Verus proof in this file.
//
// Run with:
//   verus --crate-type=lib verus/deadlock_free.rs
